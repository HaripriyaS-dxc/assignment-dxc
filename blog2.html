               <h1 style="color: darkred">posted by ABC on 12th September , 2019</h1><br>
                        <p style="text-align: justify"> The Ojai Valley Trail is a 9 mile trail that parallels Highway 33 from Foster Park on the outskirts of West Ventura, to Fox Street in Ojai. One side of the trail is paved for bicyclists, walkers, joggers, and people exercising their pets. Post-and-rail wood fence separates the paved path from a dirt bridle path for horseback riders. Sections wind through wooded areas and past riverbeds.
                        This trail has earned National Recreation Trails designation as “Ventura River Parkway Trail” that incorporates two existing trails the Ventura River Trail and the Ojai Valley Trail and connects to the Omer Rains Coastal Trail and the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail that travel north along the coastline through  Emma Wood State Beach.</p><br/>

                            We did the Cadillac North Ridge Trail from the base to the top. What beautiful vistas and views of Bar Harbor and Frenchman Bay! This trail is a gradual climb with the advantage of not coming close to the Cadillac Summit Road until near the end. It is rated Moderate by hiking guides and is 4.4 miles round trip. Take plenty of water, camera, sunscreen for top 1/3 is in the open sun with little shade. It wasn't buggy the day we went. Use the Loop Trail bus to get to the base where the trail started. There is also a small parking lot with about 10 legal spaces and about 10 spaces on the road. Would recommend hiking boots to get most traction. We saw hikers ranging from age 10 and up on the trail. We took our time and did the trail at our own pace. Once you get to the summit there is a ranger stop where you can buy popsicles, ice cream, drinks and restrooms to use before you do the hike down. Also be sure to do the Summit trail to get even more photos.Show less

                                    Beautiful trail to the peak of Mt Livermore. I arrived on the 2pm ferry from Tiburon and just about made the 4.20pm return ferry, definitely allow 2.5hrs to do this trail if going at a moderate pace! I took the north ridge trail up, the first 10 minutes were steps and the toughest part, after that it was a casual incline. This trail offers spectacular 360 views of the bay. Would definitely recommend! The trail was surprisingly quiet, not too much foot traffic, especially given it was a sunny Sunday afternoon!</p></br>

                                        It was awesome, amazing, incredible!  The 180-360 views were spectacular!  There was overgrowth on the trail, but I’m real sure that’s due to our recent rains. 
                                        I would definitely do this hike again. However, I would consider this a MODERATE hike, not easy. The incline, especially at first, would be troublesome for some. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to do it, but I did ok. One of the ladies halfway up the first incline was already saying she couldn’t go on... and there was more incline to come!
                                        We arrived on the first ferry (10AM), and after the hike enjoyed a quick lunch (which was very good, and not exorbitantly priced as some here have complained) then got on the 1:20 ferry. We didn’t get to see a lot of the other stuff, and I’d like to return to do so (and do the perimeter trail). </p>
